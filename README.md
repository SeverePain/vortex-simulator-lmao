**How to download/use the bot**

Download:

The Bot - https://github.com/SeverePain/vortex-simulator-lmao/archive/master.zip

Extract the files

Open up  "config.json" and replace the token with your user token (Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCtWDQtz6A)

Double click the file "start.bat" (if it closes instantly, that means there was an error! Talk to me!)
